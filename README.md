This will be a long term project for me. This is going to be a truly nasty one and involve graphics, math, and tears. Enjoy.<br>
We're doing machine learning<br>
I'm first wanting the machine learning alg that will detect a handwritten number.<br>
Then I want an evo sim. I'll try to find the link to the application I'm talking about.<br>
There are no tutorials for that one, and that involves physics, graphics, machine learning, and pain, but get it done and the resume boost will go utterly insaaaaaaane.<br>

This explains neural nets really well, but only the first 3 videos are useful.<br>
The 4th video shows the math behind the 3rd video, but is uneeded.<br>
The 5th, 6th, and 7th videos are about GPTs, and is well beyond the scope of what we will be doing.<br>

This is the first in a series demoing the evo sim I would like to try to program.<br>
To be clear, we need to import pytorch, but we will not be using it for anything other than the dataset. We do not need it.<br>

When you download pytorch, select cpu, and not one of the cuda options.<br>

Cool documentation on the data. IDK how it works.<br>
**Welcome to the rice fields. Now get to work**
