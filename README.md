This will be a long term project for me. This is going to be a truly nasty one and involve graphics, math, and tears. Enjoy.
Machine learning?
Yes.
I'm first wanting the machine learning alg that will detect a handwritten number.
Then I want an evo sim. I'll try to find the link to the application I'm talking about.
There are no tutorials for that one, and that involves physics, graphics, machine learning, and pain, but get it done and the resume boost will go utterly insaaaaaaane.
