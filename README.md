This will be a long term project for me. This is going to be a truly nasty one and involve graphics, math, and tears. Enjoy.<br>
Machine learning?<br>
Yes.<br>
I'm first wanting the machine learning alg that will detect a handwritten number.<br>
Then I want an evo sim. I'll try to find the link to the application I'm talking about.<br>
There are no tutorials for that one, and that involves physics, graphics, machine learning, and pain, but get it done and the resume boost will go utterly insaaaaaaane.<br>
